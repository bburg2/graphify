<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of graphify is to make a few graphs for an erasmusladder
project.

## Installation

You can install the development version of graphify from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bburg2/graphify", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(graphify)
#library(readr)
#library(here)
#library(tidyverse)
#library(dplyr)
#library(plotly)

# load in some data
## data_time <- read_csv(here("data", "data.csv"))

# Graph for Average trail duration per session per genotype
## time_graph(data_time, column = quo(`Trial duration(s)`), "Average trail duration per session per genotype", "Duration (s)")
```
